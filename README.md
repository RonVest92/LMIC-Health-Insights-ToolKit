# 🌍 LMIC Health Insights Toolkit  
**Responsible AI Prototype for Low‑ and Middle‑Income Country Health Contexts**  
*Built for Gates AI Fellows–style impact projects*

---

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates an **end‑to‑end, ethical AI pipeline** for a lightweight diagnostic aide and insights dashboard tailored to LMIC (Low‑ and Middle‑Income Country) contexts.  
It is designed to be **deployable, explainable, and fair**, with built‑in drift monitoring, subgroup fairness checks, and rapid prototyping features.

The toolkit simulates a **malaria‑like symptom triage system** using **synthetic data** (no PII) and includes:
- Predictive modeling
- Data drift detection
- Fairness evaluation
- Agent‑based weekly insights
- A rule‑based chatbot prototype
- A/B testing simulation for outreach strategies

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project aligns with the **Gates Foundation AI Fellows** mission:
- **Responsible AI**: Bias checks, explainability, and privacy by design
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Streamlit UI, FastAPI endpoints, and lightweight chatbot
- **Capacity Building**: Clear, documented code and a learning script for replication
- **LMIC Relevance**: Offline‑friendly, low‑resource deployable design

---

## 🛠 Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Realistic LMIC health scenario without privacy risks
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Logistic Regression baseline with balanced classes
- **Drift Monitoring**: MSE‑based numeric feature drift score
- **Fairness Metrics**: Precision, recall, and F1 by sensitive subgroups
- **Agent‑Based Insights**: Weekly change summaries for decision‑makers
- **Chatbot Prototype**: Pre‑field, rule‑based guidance
- **A/B Testing Simulation**: Statistical significance testing for outreach strategies

## 🗺 Project Story
This project was born from a simple but urgent question:  
**How can we make AI tools that are both powerful and practical for communities with limited resources?**

In many LMIC settings, health workers face:
- **Sparse data** and limited diagnostic tools
- **Connectivity challenges** that make cloud‑only solutions impractical
- **Equity concerns** where AI can unintentionally reinforce bias

I designed the **LMIC Health Insights Toolkit** to address these realities:
- **Synthetic data** ensures privacy while allowing open collaboration
- **Explainable models** (Logistic Regression) make outputs transparent to non‑technical stakeholders
- **Fairness metrics** highlight disparities before deployment
- **Drift monitoring** ensures models remain relevant as conditions change
- **Agent‑based insights** and **chatbot prototypes** provide actionable, human‑readable outputs
- **A/B testing** supports evidence‑based decision‑making for outreach strategies

This is not just a technical exercise — it’s a blueprint for **responsible, deployable AI** that can be adapted to health, education, and agriculture challenges in LMICs.  
It reflects my commitment to **building AI for public good**, aligning with the Gates Foundation’s vision of equitable, impactful technology.
